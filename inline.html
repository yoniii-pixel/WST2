<h2 style="color: red; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> INLINE CSS</h2>
<body style="background-color: blue; font-size: 16px;">
    <p> Inline CSS is a simple way to change how something looks on a webpage by putting the style directly inside the HTML tag. You do this using the style attribute. For example, if you want to make a sentence red, you can write: <p style="color: red;">This is red text.</p> <p style="font-size: 18px; color: red;">Inline CSS is applied directly inside the HTML element using the style attribute.</p>. That code will only change the color of that one sentence. Inline CSS is handy when you need to make a quick change or style just one element. It’s easy to use and doesn’t require much extra code. But if you use it too often, your code can get messy and harder to manage. That’s why it’s usually best for small, simple tasks.

<p>  Even though inline CSS is easy to use, it’s not the best choice for larger websites. If you want to style many things the same way, writing the same code over and over isn’t very smart or efficient. It also makes it harder to update your design later, because you have to change each item one by one. For bigger projects, it’s better to use internal or external CSS, where styles are kept in one central place. That keeps your code cleaner and easier to work with. Inline CSS is great for quick tests or one-time changes, but not for long-term use. Think of it like a sticky note — helpful for small reminders, but not something you’d use to plan an entire project.</p>
