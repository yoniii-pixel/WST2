    <h2>EMBEDDED CSS</h2>
    <p>Embedded CSS is a way to add styles to a webpage by writing them inside the HTML file, but not inside the tags. Instead, you put the CSS rules in a special section called "< style >, usually in the "< head >" part of the page. This lets you style many elements at once without repeating the same code. For example, you can say that all "< p >" tags should have blue text, and it will apply to every paragraph. It’s more organized than inline CSS because all the styles are in one place, not spread across different tags. It’s great for small websites or when you only have one page to style.</p>
